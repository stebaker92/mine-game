# AND Digital -  Challenge 5 - "Easy Does It" 

Problem:
Your task is write a miniature game :video_game:. The player is in charge of a prototype robot AND-Roid, which is sent into an active minefield. The player's task is to direct the robot with up/down/left/right commands safely through the minefield to the exit, without striking any mines.
The game map is provided here.

```
Map key:
R Robot start position
+ Wall (impassable)
# Empty space (passable)
^ Mine
E Exit
```

It's expected that your game will display the map and exit to the player, but obviously not the locations of the mines.
